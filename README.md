# Cabinet Simulation
  A C Linux multithread app that simulates the activity of a medical office: a random number of patient threads that will wait for the release of resources representing doctors (informations about doctors, patients and consultations will be displayed). Patients occupy the doctorâ€™s resource for a random period. Each patient is generated at a random interval of time.

## Example with running the program:
